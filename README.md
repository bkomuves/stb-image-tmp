A Haskell wrapper around Sean Barrett's `stb-image` JPEG/PNG/etc library
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remark: At the moment I don't have access to the source code history, but it still exists.
The idea is the new updates will be backported on the top of the old history.

For the documentation, see the [package on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stb-image)
